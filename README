MuonTag simulation (bvitali sett. 2021)

It is a mix between the corde from the LXe example and Giovanni's code.

-----------------------Work in progress-----------------------


---------------------------History----------------------------

----------02.10.2021----------
- If i move the SiPM the simulation takes longer?

----------01.10.2021----------
- candleX4 doesnt work on TTree (yet).
- i tried using a 50x0.1xthickness to see if I can change the proportion u d l r f b.
	seems like it doenst work. ASK
- move away the SiPM or at least find out the exit for the particles.
- 0.05mm and 0.1mm have some problem. try again with "/process/msc/StepLimit UseSafetyPlus"
	but i think the right solution is "/process/msc/RangeFactor 0.x"
	http://www.hep.ph.ic.ac.uk/~yoshiu/COMET/comet_g4HTMLdoc/_process_msc_.html default = 0.02
	Still nothing. the thetapositron is 90deg always for mu+28
- in DetectorConstruction the function SetCrystalSize() is a bit strange. 
	i think it needs to be changed because the particlegun is outside the world. problem?

----------27.09.2021----------
- (fEvID & (fEvID - 1)) == 0 to have a printout at powers of 2
- made the geometry as supposed to (you can do it in the run.mac... /run/reinitialise??)
- currents u d l r f b : should be the number of photons (I think?) at the external faces.
- made a analysis.cpp to draw some histo and played a bit with 'candle' option
	not sure on how canlde works and I would love to use candleX4

----------24.09.2021----------
- everything is the same but I just changed the default dimensions and added the axis in the 3D view


--------------------------Giovanni's--------------------------
It is possible to change the crystal size via cmd: /Element/det/CrysSize <length>

Datas are automatically saved in the build directory in data.root. It will be recreated at each run so you may want to change its name through:  /Analysis/SetFileName *.root

If you want you can collect the tracks of the e+ (or the parent particle) during each event.
by using /Analysis/TracksPoints n you can:
	- 0: collect the whole trajectory
	- 1: collect only the first and the last point in the crystal
	- n > 1 and n <= 10: collect n points at each event

If you want you can collect single scintillation photons information by using /Analysis/Photons 0. The default value is 1 (no single optical poton info collection).

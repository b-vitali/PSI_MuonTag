It is a mix between the corde from the LXe example and Giovanni's code.

- everything is the same but I just changed the default dimensions and added the axis in the 3D view


--------------------------Giovanni's--------------------------
It is possible to change the crystal size via cmd: /Element/det/CrysSize <length>

Datas are automatically saved in the build directory in data.root. It will be recreated at each run so you may want to change its name through:  /Analysis/SetFileName *.root

If you want you can collect the tracks of the e+ (or the parent particle) during each event.
by using /Analysis/TracksPoints n you can:
	- 0: collect the whole trajectory
	- 1: collect only the first and the last point in the crystal
	- n > 1 and n <= 10: collect n points at each event

If you want you can collect single scintillation photons information by using /Analysis/Photons 0. The default value is 1 (no single optical poton info collection).
